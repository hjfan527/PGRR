# PGRR: Pangenome Gene Reference Resource

The **Pangenome Gene Reference Resource (PGRR)** is a comprehensive pangenome of the _M. tuberculosis complex_ (MTBC), which spans all seven _M. tuberculosis_ lineages and is produced  using a virtually error-free sequencing and de novo assembly approach. It encompasses the complete panorama of genetic variation across all genes present in _M. tuberculosis_ to provide an efficient tool for performing isolated gene alignments and for accessing gene-level information from the pangenome reference strains.
