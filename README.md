# PGRR

The Pangenome Gene Reference Resource (PGRR) is a comprehensive pangenome of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), which spans all seven M. tuberculosis lineages  and is produced  using a virtually error-free sequencing and de novo assembly approach. It encompasses the complete panorama of genetic variation across all genes present in M. tuberculosis to provide an efficient tool for performing isolated gene alignments and for accessing gene-level information from the pangenome reference strains.
